## Description
- This app displays interactive graphs of the beta distribution and the beta binomial distribution.
- You can input any numerical value to the parameters(a, b, n, and sample size) to illustrate the corresponding probability functions of each distribution.
- This app allows you to intuitively compare the shape of the function of each distribution associated with any value of parameters you may want to check.
- This app is mainly created by using Streamlit and Matplotlib.
